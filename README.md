**About Dataset**
Description:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Data covers passengers only, not crew.

**Features**
survival - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
class - Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
name - Name
sex - Sex
age - Age
sibsp - Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
parch - Number of Parents/Children Aboard
ticket - Ticket Number
fare - Passenger Fare
cabin - Cabin
embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
boat - Lifeboat (if survived)
body - Body number (if did not survive and body was recovered)

**summary**
This is a classic dataset used in many data mining tutorials and demos -- perfect for getting started with exploratory analysis and building binary classification models to predict survival.
